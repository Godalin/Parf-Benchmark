[metrics] Eva coverage statistics
=======================
Syntactically reachable functions = 95 (out of 98)
Semantically reached functions = 93
Coverage estimation = 97.9% 

Unreached functions (2) =
  <lzw.c>: lzw; 
  <trees.c>: set_file_type;
[metrics] References to non-analyzed functions
------------------------------------
Function flush_block calls set_file_type (at trees.c:864)
Function main references lzw (at gzip.c:573)
